# Plan should include:
- Description of loading case.
- Numerical model.
- Verification model.
- Verification.
- Validation.
## Description of loading case
- Verbal description of the load case.
- Free body diagram of the aileron.
- Table containing all input parameters.
## Numerical Model
- Discussion of the assumptions made in your numerical model.
- Description of your numerical model. This should include a flowchart of your
program.
## Verification model

- Description of the verification model.
## Verification
- Independent verification of your own numerical model including unit tests and possibly system tests (results only for final report).
- Comparison between the results of the verification model and your numerical model, including appropriate system tests (results only for final report).
## Validation
- Comparison between the results of your numerical model and the validation data, including appropriate validation tests and associated plots (results only for final report).
